        "# Project 1: Titanic Survival EDA & Prediction Pipeline (Kaggle Beginner)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Goal & Outcome\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Goal**: Whip up a survival predictor from Titanic data, blending data sleuthing with a basic ML guesser.\n",
        "- **Outcome**: Notebook spotting \"richer = safer\" patterns; 80%+ accurate model; Kaggle score + shareable demo link.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What We're Building\n",
        "\n",
        "Hey, imagine you're piecing together a mystery novel from old ship logs: \"Did class or gender tip the scales?\" Clean the clues, sketch charts for twists, then build a \"fortune teller\" model to predict survivors. Feels cozy—like journaling insights with code.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tools/Models to Use\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Core Choices**: Stick to traditional sklearn (LogisticRegression for quick \"yes/no\" guesses—easy to explain why it works). Pandas for table magic; Seaborn for eye-candy charts; scipy for \"Is this luck?\" stats tests. Why traditional? Fast prototypes, no black-box mystery yet.\n",
        "- **Deployment Hey**: After modeling, we'll turn it into a Streamlit app (free cloud host)—upload passenger details, get \"Survival odds: 75%!\" prediction. Why Streamlit? 10 lines of code = instant web app, callable via link (no API fuss yet). Later upgrade to AWS Lambda for true API (POST JSON → response).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Detailed Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Setup (1 day)**: Grab Kaggle data (`kaggle competitions download -c titanic`). Load in Pandas (`read_csv`); peek with loops/prints. *Why?* Sets the stage—like unpacking a box. *If Stuck:* Colab template search \"Titanic starter.\"\n",
        "2. **EDA & Cleaning (2 days)**: Query/fix NAs (`fillna`); groupby survival rates; SQL pandasql for \"SELECT AVG from classes.\" *Why?* Uncovers stories (e.g., \"Kids first!\"). *If Stuck:* Copy-paste from Kaggle kernels.\n",
        "3. **Viz & Stats (1 day)**: Bar plots (`sns.barplot`); heatmaps (`corr()`); t-tests (`ttest_ind` ages). *Why?* Visual \"whoa\" moments. *If Stuck:* Seaborn gallery for inspo.\n",
        "4. **Modeling (2 days)**: Split data; fit Logistic + DT (`plot_tree`); score F1/confusion. Pipeline scale + model. *Why?* Traditional = reliable baseline. *If Stuck:* Sklearn docs examples.\n",
        "5. **Eval & Deploy (1 day)**: KFold CV; learning curves. *Deployment:* Add Streamlit: `st.text_input('Age')` → model.predict → `st.write('Survives?')`. Host on Streamlit Cloud (upload to GitHub, click \"Deploy\"). Test: Share link, input fake passenger—boom, API-like call! *Why?* Makes it \"usable\"—friends query without code. *If Stuck:* Streamlit \"Hello World\" tutorial (5 mins).\n",
